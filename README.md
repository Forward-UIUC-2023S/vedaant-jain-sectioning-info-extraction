# Section-Based-IE-From-Academic-Resumes

## Overview

This module is responsible for sectioning an academic resume into sections according to titles, and then using a fine-tuned version of BERT to extract information from education, employment, and publication sections. 

## Setup

List the steps needed to install your module's dependencies: 

1. Python version: 3.9.6, cuda version: 11.1.

2. Install DiT and detectron2 using the instructions here: https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/dit

3. Then run the requirements.txt file in the root folder in this repository. 

4. Include instructions on how to run any tests you have written to verify your module is working properly. 

It is very important to also include an overall breakdown of your repo's file structure. Let people know what is in each directory and where to look if they need something specific. This will also let users know how your repo needs to structured so that your module can work properly

Include text description of all the important files / componenets in your repo. 
* `Text-Based-IE/`: contains notebooks to train the models for different section's information extraction
* `Inference/`: contains scripts for running inference
* `Inference/ResumeSeqTagger.py`: base class from which the education, employment, and publication model classes inherit methods
* `Inference/ResumeInfoExtractor`: this class has memebers for sectioning a resume and also extracting information from appropriate sections
* `Inference/RunInference.ipynb`: extracts information from a resume page image
* `Inference/RunSectionDivider.ipynb`: extracts section from a resume page image
* `title-detection-evaluation/DivideImage.ipynb`: evaluates performance of model to recognise titles based on bounding boxes from resumes pages using the data
* `data/text_data/`: contains data in CONLL format for sequence tagging for education, employment, publications
* `data/title_annotated_images/`: the result.json files contain annotations for the images of resume pages labelling the title bounding boxes
* `data/resume_images/`: contains images of resume pages corresponding to the resume pdfs present in the resume_pdfs folder, Note all resume images have not been included because of size but can be extracted from the corresponding pdfs.

```

## Functional Design (Usage)
Describe all functions / classes that will be available to users of your module. This section should be oriented towards users who want to _apply_ your module! This means that you should **not** include internal functions that won't be useful to the user in this section. You can think of this section as a documentation for the functions of your package. Be sure to also include a short description of what task each function is responsible for if it is not apparent. You only need to provide the outline of what your function will input and output. You do not need to write the pseudo code of the body of the functions. 

* Takes as input a list of strings, each representing a document and outputs confidence scores for each possible class / field in a dictionary
```python
    def classify_docs(docs: list[str]):
        ... 
        return [
            { 'cs': cs_score, 'math': math_score, ..., 'chemistry': chemistry_score },
            ...
        ]
```

* Outputs the weights as a numpy array of shape `(num_classes, num_features)` of the trained neural network 
```python
    def get_nn_weights():
        ...
        return W
```


## Algorithmic Design 
This section should contain a detailed description of all different components and models that you will be using to achieve your task as well as a diagram. Here is a very basic example of what you should include:

We generate vector representations for each document using BERT, we then train a simple, single-layer fully connected neural network using the documents and labels from the training set.

First, we select a set of labeled text documents `d_1, d_2, â€¦, d_N` from the arxiv dataset available on Kaggle. The documents are randomly partitioned into two sets for training and testing. We use the BERT language model's output as the input to the neural network. Only the weights of the neural network are modified during training. 

After training, we run the trained model to classify the test documents into one of the classes in C. Below is a picture of the architecture of the module. The diagram below was constructed using draw.io

## Issues and Future Work

In this section, please list all know issues, limitations, and possible areas for future improvement. For example:

* High false negative rate for document classier. 
* Over 10 min run time for one page text.
* Replace linear text search with a more efficient text indexing library (such as whoosh)
* Include an extra label of "no class" if all confidence scores low. 


## Change log

Use this section to list the _major_ changes made to the module if this is not the first iteration of the module. Include an entry for each semester and name of person working on the module. For example

Include a brief summary of your module here. For example: this module is responsible for classifying pieces of text using a neural network on top of BERT. 

Note: if this is a second or latter iteration of a module, you may reuse the old iteration's README as a starting point (you should still update it).
